0:00 Let's look at this core concept of dictionaries.
0:02 Dictionaries are kind of like lists and they will store 
0:05 a bunch of different types of data for you,
0:08 but lists are very limited in the way you can get that data back,
0:11 you can only get that back by index. 
0:14 So I can get the third item, or the hundredth item or the minus one item 
0:18 even to go and get the last out of the list but that's problematic in a lot of ways,
0:21 a much better way to store data if we are going to randomly access it 
0:26 is by some name that makes sense to people not just an index, 
0:29 so here we have an information thing, 
0:32 maybe it talks about a person's age and the location,
0:35 so here we have a dictionary 
0:38 and we are setting the age to be 42 and the location to be Italy, 
0:41 so that first part we can kind of dynamically build it up, 
0:44 but we can also use the two steps below right here 
0:48 where we can allocate and populate the dictionary all at once,
0:52 so those next two lines those are two ways to do the identical same bit of code 
0:56 to create a dictionary that has an age of 42 and a location of Italy. 
1:01 When we want data out of the dictionary, instead of using a number, 
1:05 we just use a key in this case we would like that location information back 
1:09 so we just say quote location, here we are using a string, it could be a number, 
1:12 it could be something much more complicated even 
1:14 and that will actually give us the location back, that value is Italy. 
1:17 If you are not sure if a key is in the dictionary, 
1:20 and you try to access it you will get a key error exception. 
1:24 So if we want to get the age value out of info and it's not guaranteed 
1:29 that age is actually in there, you ask this somewhat non obvious 
1:33 but pretty cool way of saying if age in info and that will return true
1:37 only if there is some value for age inside of info.
