0:00 Hello my Linux friends! 
0:02 Let's talk about what you've got to setup on your machine to do this class,
0:06 in the same way that I am, at least,
0:08 you will see that you actually already have Python and Python 3
0:11 installed on Linux if you are using something like Ubuntu,
0:14 so that's pretty awesome.
0:16 I'll show you where to go to get it if you don't happen to have it
0:18 and I'll show you how to install PyCharm.
0:22 It works wonderfully on Linux 
0:23 but it's a little bit of a pain to set it up so I'll walk you through that.  
0:27 So, here we are over in Ubuntu 15,
0:31 brand new fresh version I literally just downloaded,
0:34 and we are on the PyCharm page.
0:36 So we can go and download PyCharm,
0:38 you will see there is actually two versions,
0:40 there is a professional version and a community edition,
0:43 we are going to download the professional edition,
0:45 you can get a 30 day free trial and if you pay for it like I do,
0:49 then obviously, you can have it forever.
0:52 The main difference between the community and the professional edition,
0:55 the community edition is always free,
0:57 is... the community edition does a whole bunch of cool Python stuff
1:00 but it doesn't do web or database work,
1:02 the professional edition does,
1:03 in addition to standard Python things, web frameworks,
1:07 type script, database designer type things.
1:11 So, for this course, you can totally go by with community
1:14 but for a professional work, well,
1:16 maybe professional is the thing to go with.  
1:18 Some of the other editors you might choose
1:20 if for some reason you don't want to use PyCharm,
1:22 is you could use Atom, it is a really great editor from GitHub,
1:25 I really like it and the video is hilarious so check out the video, just for a laugh.
1:30 Sublime text is very popular,
1:32 and of course, you can use Emacs or Vim that a lot of people are using.
1:35 As I said, Ubuntu comes with Python 2 and 3
1:38 but for some reason if you need to download it,
1:40 just come over here, python.org,
1:42 grab the latest version it'll automatically find the right thing for your operating system,
1:46 you could also install it with aptitude,
1:49 you can do things like apt-get install python3 -dev,
1:52 there is a couple of packages that you can install.
1:56 So first, let's verify that I actually do have Python installed,
1:59 Python 3 so I can say python3 --version,
2:03 and we have 3.4.3+, which makes it even better than 3.4.3,
2:08 awesome, and then we have PyCharm,
2:10 we are going to go download it, it's kind of big,
2:12 so I actually already downloaded it,
2:14 go over to my downloads folder, and we have the tarball (tar.gz) right here.
2:18 So we need to decompress this and copy it somewhere,
2:22 so I come over here, right click and say extract here,
2:25 and it will extract it out.
2:27 Now it has the version name here, let's find,
2:31 let's make it new location, let's put it in my home,
2:34 I like to create a folder called bin in my home and then here
2:38 I'll make a folder called pycharm
2:40 and within pycharm I'll put pycharm-5.0.4.
2:45 Now if you open it up you'll see there is nothing to run right away
2:47 but there is a bin folder within there and what we want to do is
2:50 we want to run this script,
2:52 so I could double click it, and it will just open in gedit, not the best, 
2:56 so I am going to come over here and just drop it into my terminal and run it.
3:01 Now, it turns out, there is a problem,
3:04 PyCharm is built on the IntelliJ platform,
3:07 IDE platform, and that platform is Java based,
3:10 so we need to install Java, before we can carry on.
3:15 So on Ubuntu, we'll just use apt-get so we'll say sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk.
3:23 And I'll put in my password, I'll wait for a moment, and says
3:26 are you sure you want to do this, it might take a moment
3:29 171 MG's, it's fine, go
3:37 Excellent, well, that took a minute, but now we have Java installed,
3:42 let's try to run that again, PyCharm shell, now it's running,
3:46 you can see it says do you want to import previous versions? well no,
3:49 it's a brand new machine so no, not really;
3:51 normally I would just log in with my JetBrains account but for now,
3:54 I'll just evaluate it for free, which you guys should be able to do for this class.
4:02 When PyCharm first opens, 
4:03 it asks us what keyboard map and visual theme we would like,
4:08 I am going to leave the keyboard map alone
4:10 but I like my code my IDEs and windows and stuff to be dark, not bright, 
4:15 so dark background light code,
4:18 so I am going to pick the Dracula theme for both
4:20  the code colors as well as IDE theme, and I will say ok,
4:28 and it can't make the change unless you restart, so yeah, let's let it restart. 
4:33 Excellent, my PyCharm is running, it's nice and dark with its Dracula theme.
4:37 Now the one other thing I'd like to do is notice it's over here,
4:41 and I kind of like to not be running this shell script anymore straight from the terminal,
4:45 so let's run it one more time, notice it's gone from the launcher.
4:49 Now it's up and running, I can lock it to the launcher,
4:52 and now this way, when it's gone, I want to launch it again,
4:55 I can just come over here and launch it straight out of launcher.
4:58 Congratulations, you have PyCharm working on Ubuntu,
5:02 it's time to head on over and build your first app 
5:04 and have a great time doing it!
