0:00 It's time for app number 3, 
0:01 this time we are going to write an app that'll answer the question
0:04 how long until your birthday. 
0:07 So what exactly are we going to build? 
0:09 We are going to build an app that looks like this
0:11 it's going to have a little header 
0:12 saying birthday app like all of our apps do,
0:15 and then it's going to first ask a couple of questions of the user
0:19 when were they born, 
0:20 so ask the year, month and day, 
0:23 and then pull those back, 
0:25 those will come back as strings, 
0:26 we'll convert those to numbers, 
0:27 and use those numbers to actually come up with a date object, 
0:32 that represents a particular time on the calendar, 
0:34 and then we'll do a little math with that date, relative to today, 
0:39 and we'll use that to answer the question how long is it until your birthday 
0:44 and if you have already had your birthday 
0:45 we'll say hey your birthday was so many days ago. 
0:49 So again, that looks pretty straightforward, 
0:50 but we are going to learn a lot.
0:53 We are going to come back to working with functions 
0:56 and organizing our code into small, reusable pieces of functionality 
1:00 and in our previous example, 
1:02 we saw that we worked with functions 
1:03 but they were sort of the most basic, 
1:06 they were just things you would call to have actions 
1:08 and here we are going to have functions 
1:10 that both take parameters 
1:12 and so we can supply different values to them
1:14 like a particular date and the return values, 
1:17 the things like how many days from this particular date until now. 
1:22 The other major thing we'll focus on 
1:24 is dates and times and time spans, 
1:27 so when you work with dates and times between dates, 
1:30 in Python these are the 3 basic concepts
1:33 that you'll see and they will be central to this app.
