0:00 So we have our app working
0:02 but the user feedback could be a little better
0:04 let's go down here and try to improve
0:06 this message we sent to the user
0:08 instead of just too low, let's say
0:09 something like your guess of... and we can put in this number
0:14 this guess they had here
0:16 we saw that we could do this by combining strings by saying guess
0:19 so maybe you'll think well this is a way I can do this here
0:22 and this will just combine it
0:23 that does work in certain languages
0:25 say your guess of let's say 70 was too low, something like that.
0:30 Now, PyCharm is kind of giving away the surprise here,
0:35 but this is not really love that says
0:38 the string int conversion with plus is not going to work out so well for you
0:42 So let's just run it and find out.
0:44 So if I enter something that is going to be for sure too low like 0,
0:47 let's see what happens, you get this exception,
0:49 you cannot convert int object to string, implicitly.
0:52 Well we technically could explicitly convert it
0:54 but it turns out that there is a much better way in Python.
0:58 What we want to do is we kind of want to put something into this space,
1:01 now the way we can do this nice way
1:04 is we can use these little curly braces inside the string
1:07 and then call a function on the string called format
1:10 and pass whatever we want to go in there.
1:12 And so, into this location we can say we'd like
1:15 to take the guess and explicitly convert it to a string,
1:18 whatever that means,
1:19 this time it's a number,
1:21 so that is pretty straightforward,
1:22 and then we are going to put the result of it right there.
1:25 We can actually pass many parameters here,
1:27 we could have something like name,
1:29 like let's change this really quick
1:30 name=input player what is your name
1:35 and these little numbers that go in here
1:37 talk about the order in which there is specified in the format method.
1:41 So guess is first, everything is zero based,
1:44 so it gets a zero, name is second, so it's {1},
1:47 so we could say sorry {1} your guess of {0} was too low.
1:53 Now let's go and run this,
1:55 see if everything is working,
1:56 enter your name, my name is Michael,
1:58 enter a guess, I am going to put 0,
2:00 sorry Michael your guess of 0 was too low.
2:03 Now, we are just scratching the surface of the power of this format method.
2:08 We can if we wanted to switch the order here,
2:12 if we specify the place holders in the string
2:16 in the same order as they are specified as arguments there
2:18 we can actually omit the number
2:21 now this will say sorry name
2:23 your guess of... whatever the number was, was too low.
2:26 We can put in format specifiers here to say
2:28 I'd like to separate this with commas or convert it to currency,
2:33 or all sorts of sort of format specifiers
2:36 we can take dictionaries and name these things
2:39 and pull items out of the dictionary by name
2:40 and then put their values in here, it's very rich,
2:43 but let's just go with this for now.
2:45 So we'll do the too high case here,
2:47 so your guess was too high, and finally,
2:49 we'll just say something nice about winning
2:53 excellent work so and so, you won
2:57 it was something like this, right?
2:59 so excellent work, whatever the name is and you won
3:01 it was whatever the guess was.
3:03 So, let's play the game again,
3:05 all right, what's your name, now I've got to enter my name,
3:07 it's Michael,
3:08 I am going to guess 50- wow 50 was too high,
3:11 25- too low,
3:12 35, 40,
3:14 45
3:16 47,
3:17 what do you think,
3:19 46, chances are likely, 
3:21 YES! excellent work Michael, you won, it was 46.
3:24 See how we can use string format to really simplify and clarify
3:28 how we convert values into strings.
