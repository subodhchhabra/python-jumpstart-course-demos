0:00 Now, before we move on to our next application
0:03 let's take a quick tour of PyCharm. 
0:05 So, PyCharm has so many features,
0:08 it's very hard to just sit down and show them to you.
0:10 But let's just take a moment and hit the highlights.
0:12 So on the left over here we have our project, folder, 
0:15 and this can be quite complex,
0:17 in real apps you might find many subdirectories,
0:20 multiple files, all sorts of stuff, we'll get to that later.
0:23 But here we just have our directory and our program.py, 
0:27 and it actually shows the external libraries that are set up
0:30 into the particular Python environment that we are working with.
0:33 So you can see that we have things like Pygments,
0:36 and Chameleon which is a web templating framework
0:39 and mailchimp for managing subscribers, things like that.
0:43 Not super important for us now,
0:44 but this sort of lets you get at your active Python environment.
0:48 We can also go over to the structure,
0:50 and the structure for this app is frankly boring,
0:53 because it just has a few variables and that's it,
0:56 but if we had functions which were using classes
1:00 and these classes were defined with more functions
1:03 and fields and attributes and properties, all this kinds of things,
1:07 you would see this would actually be quite interesting,
1:09 you can use all these little pieces up here to slice and dice them.
1:12 Down at the bottom, we have our run configuration,
1:15 or a place where we would run our app
1:17 you can see there is actually two of them running,
1:19 that's kind of a problem, we'll talk about how to fix that.
1:24 So we can come over here, we can run it,
1:25 we can stop the running one, you can see this one as a green dot
1:28 because it's running, so we can stop this... it's all good.
1:31 We can also have TODO's so we could come over and put a comment;
1:35 comments in Python start with "#" hash so I could say,
1:37 # TODO "this needs cleaned up",
1:41 something like that and I could say something like TODO.
1:45 All right, so now if you look down here
1:47 you can see it actually shows us our TODO's
1:49 PyCharm highlights them very nicely up here.
1:51 Take those back out but that's what this section is for.
1:54 Here is just a Python console you can...
1:57 as if you typed Python in the terminal or the command prompt,
2:00 here is literally a terminal,
2:03 and here is the version control that we talked about.
2:06 There is support for all different kinds of version control,
2:09 you can see we are actually working on the master branch in GitHub.
2:12 Over here, on the right
2:14 we have a database section,
2:15 some really excellent database management
2:18 and design and querying tools built in the PyCharm.
2:21 We don't have a database that we are working with right now,
2:24 but if we did, we would connect it here
2:26 and like it do all sorts of cool stuff.
2:28 Finally we have sort of run, debug and manage
2:31 version control shortcuts up here.
2:34 We come up here, we can look at the configuration
2:36 you can see we can actually pass parameters like
2:40 if I want to just hard code a name and pass it like this,
2:43 this would be passed to our program when it runs,
2:46 we are not going to do that but we could
2:47 you could pick which version of Python you want to run
2:50 pass additional options to the interpreter itself
2:53 there is all kinds of things that we can do here.
2:56 Remember we had two instances of that app running
2:59 that was kind of weird so we can check off this single instance only
3:02 and that actually fixes that problem,
3:04 so you only ever have one running at a time.
3:07 Now when I run it, if it's running and I try to run it again
3:09 it will say we are going to restart it for you,
3:12 so I often say don't bother me with that just run it again whenever I ask, ok?
3:17 So like I said, there are many things you can do with PyCharm,
3:21 stuff with version control,
3:23 stuff with managing virtual machines,
3:26 all kinds of stuff that we just don't need to get into right now
3:29 but what you saw should give you a really good jumpstart
3:32 so you can be effective with PyCharm right away.
